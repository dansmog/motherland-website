            The idea for Motherland was born from my hearing the incessant
            stories of hardworking diaspora Nigerians who have had their life's
            earnings squandered by someone who they trusted to build their
            retirement home. This is an unreliable retirement strategy for many
            diaspora Nigerians, who fall victim everyday.
